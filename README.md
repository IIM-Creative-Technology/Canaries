The purpose of this branch was to try to create a database using NoSQL trought MongoDB and Mongoose.

I started using a SQL database but soon realised that it was not the best option for a NodeJS project that needed real time exchange.

That's why we tried to reorient the project on MongoDB Atlas and Mongoose. Unfortunelety, it's not over yet and not fully functional. There are still some issues on the import of data trought the collection and managing to link it with Socket.io and our game.
